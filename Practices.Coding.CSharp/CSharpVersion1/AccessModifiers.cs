/*1. Interfaces declard directly with in a namespace can be public or internal and, just
 * like classes and structs, interfaces default to internal access. 
 * 
 * 2. interface defaults to internal access modifier.
 * 3. interface members are public by default.
 * 
 * 4. Enumeration members are always public, and no access modifiers can be applied.
 * 
 * 5. Delegates behave like classes and structs. By defaultm, they have internal access when delcared 
 *    directly with in a namespace, and private access when nested.
